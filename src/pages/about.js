                <p>
                    I am a 4th year student of Gazi University
                    Computer Engineering. I chose my
                    department due to my software
                    development studies. I started to
                    participate in activities and work in the field
                    of cyber security after I started university. I
                    made their own websites from scratch on
                    demand for the 3b4m company. I used PHP,
                    Javascript, Ajax, Jquery technologies for
                    backend on the Netlise Social Network
                    website, which reached 400 members in
                    the week it opened in the second grade of
                    high school. I published the interfaces of
                    the websites and programs I wrote in
                    middle school and high school along with
                    their photographs on Github. Except for
                    Web Development, I made games using the
                    python's pygame library, following OOP
                    techniques as taught in schools. Games
                    written with pygame, cryptographic
                    encryption software written using personal
                    Affine Algorithm, my simple image
                    recognition program labeled with Linear
                    Regression Algorithm used as one of the
                    basic models is online with my social
                    network site Netlise on my Github account.
                    You can access much more on my website.
